# Big Mart Product Sales - Predictive Machine Learning Model
### R Studio Data Analysis - Analyzing in-Store Metrics to Predict Product Sales

### This project aimed to **successfully predict product sales** using in store specifications such as: product visibility, maximal retail price, product type, etc.
To do this, I:
- Collaborated with a team to explore different modern regression models.
- Delivered the identification of the certain predictors that would be able to predict total sales per product

#### As a result, **we fitted the commonly known linear regression**, achieving an interpretable, robust model to predict total sales per product.

Below are the predictors that were significant, along with most important recommendations to key stakeholders.

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the project.

In this project, I tested various regression models, namely LASSO Regressions with k-fold Cross Validation, boosting regression, random forest regression, linear regression, and more.
